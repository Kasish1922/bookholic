            <h2 class="titleText">Best Seller of 2023 - "Spare"</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
                Spare is a memoir by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, which was released on 10 January 2023. It was ghostwritten by J. R. Moehringer and published by Penguin Random House.The book was highly anticipated and was accompanied by several major broadcast interviews.
                The title refers to the aristocratic adage that an "heir and a spare" was needed to ensure that an inheritance remained in the family.</p>
            <br>In the book, Harry details his childhood and the profound effect of the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as his teenage years, and subsequent deployment to Afghanistan with the British Army. He writes about his relationship
            with his brother, Prince William, and his father, King Charles III, and his father's marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles, as well as his courtship and marriage to the American actress Meghan Markle and the couple's subsequent stepping back from
            their royal roles.</br>
            <br>Spare received generally mixed reviews from critics, some who praised Harry's openness but were critical of the inclusion of too many personal details. According to Guinness World Records, Spare became "the fastest selling non-fiction
            book of all time" on the date of its release.</br>

                    The Forty Rules of Love is a 2009 novel by Elif Shafak. The book tells the story of Ella Rubinstein, a woman in her late thirties who has settled into the complacency of her life. She exists without drive or passion. The narrative follows her unlikely
                    escape from what at first appears to be inevitable unhappiness. The novel also concerns itself with the deep, fraternal love between Sufi dervish Shams of Tabriz and the mystical scholar-poet Rumi.
